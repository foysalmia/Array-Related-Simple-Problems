# Array-related problems
This problems are very simple and basic problems in array concept of C++ .
Solultions are inserted in .cpp file by question number. 


## Question 1

WAP that will take n integer numbers into an array, and then sum up all the integers in that array.

```
INPUT 1
5
1  2  3  4  5
```
```
OUTPUT 1
15
```
```
INPUT 2
6
2  8  3  9  0  1

```
```
OUTPUT 2
23
```


## Question 2

WAP that will take n integer numbers into an array, and then sum up all the integers in the even indexed Position. 

```
INPUT 1
5
1  2  3  4  5
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
9
```
```
INPUT 2
6
2  8  3  9  0  1
```
```
OUTPUT 2
5
```
## Question 3

WAP that will take n integer numbers into an array, and then reverse all the integers within that array. Finally, print them all from 0 index to the last valid index.

```
INPUT 1
5
1  2  3  4  5
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
5  4  3  2  1
```
```
INPUT 2
6
2  8  3  9  0  1
```
```
OUTPUT 2
1  0  9  3  8  2
```

## Question 4
WAP that will take n integer numbers into an array, and then find the maximum -minimum among them with its index position.

```
INPUT 1
5
1  2  3  4  5
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
Max: 5, Index: 4
Min: 1, Index: 0
```
```
INPUT 2
6
2  8  3  9  0  1
```
```
OUTPUT 2
Max: 9, Index: 3
Min: 0, Index: 4
```

## Question 5
WAP that will take n integers into an array, and then search a number into that array. If found then print its index. If not found then print “NOT FOUND”.
```
INPUT 1
8
7 8 1 3 2 6 4 3
3
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
FOUND at index position: 3, 7
```
```
INPUT 2
8
7 8 1 3 2 6 4 3
5
```
```
OUTPUT 2
NOT FOUND
```
## Question 6
WAP that will take n integers into an array A and m positive integers into array B. Now find the intersection (set operation) of arrays A and B.
```
INPUT 1
8
7 8 1 5 2 6 4 3
6
1 3 6 0 9 2
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
1 2 6 3
```
```
INPUT 2
3
1 2 3
2
4 5
```
```
OUTPUT 2
Empty set
```

## Question 7
WAP that will take n positive integers into an array A. Now find all the integers that are divisible by 3 and replace them by -1 in array A. Finally show all elements of array A.
```
INPUT 1
8
7 8 1 3 2 6 4 3
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
7 8 1 -1 2 -1 4 -1
```
```
INPUT 2
3
3 2 1
```
```
OUTPUT 2
-1 2 1
```
## Question 8
WAP that will take n integers into an array A. Now remove all duplicate numbers from that array. Finally, print all elements from that array. 
```
INPUT 1
8
2 8 1 3 2 6 4 3
```
```
OUTPUT 1 
2 8 1 3 6 4
```
```
INPUT 2
3
3 3 3
```
```
OUTPUT 2
3
```
```
INPUT 3
4
6 7 8 9
```
```
OUTPUT 3
6 7 8 9
```
